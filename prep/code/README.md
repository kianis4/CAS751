# CAS 751 Prep Code Starters

Small, self-contained scripts to build intuition quickly. Each has clear TODOs and prints/plots minimal outputs.

- 01_divergences_mi.py — compute KL/TV/JS between Gaussians; simulate MI in a binary symmetric channel (BSC).
- 02_dp_mechanisms.py — Laplace/Gaussian mechanisms for counts/means; empirical DP checks.
- 03_rdp_accountant_dp_sgd.py — toy logistic regression with DP‑SGD; simple RDP accountant sweep.
- 04_ldp_randomized_response.py — RR estimators (binary/k‑ary); variance vs ε,k,n.
- 05_fairness_audit_thresholds.py — per‑group metrics, calibration, threshold tuning for EO/EOp.
